# **Spring Boot AWS ECS Deployment Pipeline**  
**A CI/CD pipeline for containerized Spring Boot applications on AWS Fargate**

This project demonstrates a complete infrastructure-as-code solution for deploying Spring Boot applications to AWS using:  
- **AWS ECS Fargate** (serverless containers)  
- **AWS CodePipeline** (CI/CD automation)  
- **AWS CodeBuild** (build/test)  
- **Amazon ECR** (Docker image storage)  

## **Key Features**  
✅ **Automated deployments** triggered by GitHub commits  
✅ **Dockerized** Spring Boot application with multi-stage builds 
✅ **Blue-green deployment** readiness  
✅ **Health checks** and monitoring integration
